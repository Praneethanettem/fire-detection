# image processinng based firedetection project using python
This Python script uses OpenCV and a Haar Cascade Classifier to detect fire in real-time through a webcam. It continuously captures video frames, processes them, and identifies areas with fire-like patterns. If fire is detected, the script highlights the affected region, saves multiple frames in a "detected" folder, and displays a warning on the screen. To use this program, ensure you have installed the necessary dependencies (numpy, cv2), place the fire_detection.xml file in the same directory, and run the script with a connected webcam. The program applies various image processing techniques, such as Gaussian blurring to reduce noise and bilateral filtering to enhance details before converting frames to grayscale for fire detection. The Haar Cascade Classifier scans the grayscale image, and when fire is identified, a visual alert is shown, and frames are saved for reference. Users can fine-tune detection accuracy by adjusting parameters like the scale factor and minimum neighbors, modifying the file-saving path, or experimenting with different image processing methods. Press 'ESC' to exit the program. This script is provided as-is with no guarantees, and users are free to modify it according to their needs while adhering to OpenCVâ€™s licensing terms.
